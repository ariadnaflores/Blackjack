# Blackjack
Blackjack is a game played with regular cards. Playing cards consist of a ‘pip’, the numeric or face value of the card, and a suit. Initially, the player receives two
cards in a hand. The goal of the game is for the cards’ pip total to equal and not exceed 21. Face cards are counted as 10, Aces as 11 and the other cards as their 
numeric pip value. (In the real game, Aces can be 1 or 11, but for our purposes you can count them as 11)
